4)Download the Data folder also and save it in 2 places, 1st place inside the SkinDisorderAngular/SkinDisorder/src/app/server in order for the python file to read it and use it
	2nd place is inside the SkinDisorderAngular/SkinDisorder/src/app/assets for the correct relative links to work for prediction.
5)Run the python backend Server, and then run the angular frontend by typing ' ng serve' in terminal inside the SkinDisorderAngular/SkinDisorder/src/
- if you have done all the steps correcly you should see in the python server '200' response that they are connected correctly
